### [nagios](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/nagios) v1.2.2

  The nagios cookbook, now at version 1.2.0, has received a lot of updates lately:

  * There's a new recipe which makes integrating your Nagios with PagerDuty.com as easy as adding a ['nagios']['pagerduty_key'] attribute to your node.
  * A new lightweight resource provider was added for defining NRPE checks
  * You can now define nagios checks using databags.

  Big thanks to Jake Vanderdray from CustomInk for making monitoring with nagios suck a little bit less!

### [annoyances](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/annoyances] v0.0.1

  Matt Ray and Joshua Timberman, from OpsCode, have released an Annoyances cookbook.  This cookbook fixes a number of minor operating system-based annoyances. The are recipes are platform-specific.

  On Ubuntu the cookbook will freshen up the apt repository and turn off AppArmor and byobu (beeyo-bu)
  On Red Hat flavors including CentOS and scientific linux, the cookbook will delete any preexisting firewall rules, turn off SELinux, uninstall apache, and remove any .bash_logout

  This cookbook will remove itself from the node's runlist on completion.

  Are there things that annoy you about your target Operating System?  Fork this cookbook and submit a pull request!

Many of the Opscode cookbooks were also recently updated. One of the changes that was recommended during the [Opscode Community Summit](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Opscode+Community+Summit+1) 
back in December was to split up the opscode/cookbooks repository in to individual repositories, one for each cookbook.  Much 
of the groundwork for doing this has been added to the cookbooks.  This includes adding LICENSE and CONTRIBUTING files to each cookbook 
and moving the "changes" section to a new CHANGELOG markdown file with each cookbook.  Some noteworthy updates include:

* [chef-client](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/chef-client) v1.1.2

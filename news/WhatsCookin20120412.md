Hello food fight listeners and Chef enthusiasts! This is Nathen Harvey with "What's Cookin'"

## In the News:

* [Seth Falcon](http://twitter.com/sfalcon), Development Lead at Opscode, recently published his presentation, "[How to Migrate a Web App to Erlang, Change Databases, and Not Have Your Customers Notice](http://speakerdeck.com/u/sfalcon/p/how-to-migrate-a-web-app-to-erlang-change-databases-and-not-have-your-customers-notice)."  Check out the slides over on Speaker Deck.

* While you're at Speaker Deck, check out [@lusis](http://twitter.com/lusis)'s [UnNamed Talk](http://speakerdeck.com/u/lusis/p/the-unnamed-talk) which is a talk about ops, logs, and metrics with a bit of Wil Wheaton thrown in for good measure. 

* [Hector Castro](http://twitter.com/hectcastro) recently [wrote a post on the Trading Fish blog](http://hectcastro.me/2012/03/31/running-chef-recipes-once.html) about Running Chef Recipes Once.  With a small block of code, you can remove a recipe from a nodeâ€™s run list after successful execution.

* [Cryptocracy](http://www.cryptocracy.com/blog/2012/04/07/chef-lwrp-managed-directory/) blog, Zac Stevens announced a managed_directory LWRP he's been working on.  It provides an LWRP to declare that a directory's contents are entirely managed by Chef. When a node is converged, any files present in the managed_directory that are not managed by Chef will be removed.  This is still a work in progress with the code posted on [github](https://github.com/zts/chef-cookbook-managed_directory).  Be sure to read the caveats in the README before using the LWRP.  Let Zac know if this is something you're interested in.  He's looking for suggestions and pull requests.

* Recently, [Fletcher Nichol](http://twitter.com/fnichol) posted [a comment in a github issue](https://github.com/fnichol/chef-rbenv/issues/9#issuecomment-5035721) that provided a little detail on Chef's 2-phase run.   From time-to-time you see or hear about flame wars raging on github around a specific issue or commit.  It's great to see this sort of comment and collaboration happening in our space.

* [Sam Pikesley](http://twitter.com/pikesley) has started a Chef tutorial, [Learn Yourself Some Chef](http://pikesley.github.com/learn-yourself-some-chef/).  Run through the tutorial or contribute your own lessons on github.

* GeekWire, an independent technology news site and online community based in Seattle, Washington recently announced some Start Up awards and Opscode is up for an award in the "Next Tech Titan" category.  Head over to [Geekwire](http://www.geekwire.com/events/geekwire-presents-seattle-20-startup-awards/#custom) to cast your vote.  Check the show notes for a link.

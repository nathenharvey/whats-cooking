Cookbook testing

Python Cookbook - Joshua Timberman
I released new versions of the python (v1.0.6) and application cookbook (v0.99.14) earlier today.

pip v1.1 removed the -E option, and now the preference is to use the pip in a virtualenv to install packages. This was resolved in COOK-1046 by Justin Huff[0]. This also affected the application::django recipe[1], in that it used the -E option to install packages from the requirements.txt file, but the pip binary itself was not executed from the virtualenv.

I also updated these cookbooks in the django-quick-start guide[2].

Cookbook testing threads



I tried to get this all completed in time for Valentine's day, but as
you can see, there was a lot to do.

Total cookbooks released: 19.
Total tickets resolved: 47.
Average amount of love given to contributors: Immeasurable!

Thank you everyone who contributed to these releases. Andrea Campi,
Jamie Winsor, and Bryan Berry have put in a lot of hard work improving
some of our most popular cookbooks, apache2, mysql, nginx and java,
particularly. Thanks guys, you're awesome.

With these releases done, we're down to only 10 issues that have been
triaged and are awaiting a merge, and 7 issues that are resolved but
not triaged yet. This puts us in a pretty good place to start the
effort to move each of the cookbooks out of the monolithic cookbooks
repository into their own separate repository.

While we do send out these cookbook release announcements to the list
periodically, you can keep up with cookbook development on an
individual cookbook basis, as well. If you have an Opscode community
site user, you can follow specific cookbooks, and set up notification
settings. Simply click the big orange "Follow" button on a cookbook's
page, and go to your profile to edit when you get email notifications.

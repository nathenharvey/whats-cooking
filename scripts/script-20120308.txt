The nagios cookbook, now at version 1.2.2, has received a lot of updates lately.  Previously you had to edit the default templates
to add custom checks.  Now you just need to add attributes, databag items, and utilize the new lightweight resource provider (LWRP) 
for defining NRPE checks.

Big thanks to Jake Vanderdray from CustomInk for making monitoring with nagios suck a little bit less!

##################################

Matt Ray and Joshua Timberman, from OpsCode, have released an Annoyances cookbook.  This cookbook fixes a number of minor operating 
system-based annoyances. The are recipes are platform-specific.

On Ubuntu the cookbook will freshen up the apt repository and turn off AppArmor and byobu (beeyo-bu)

On Red Hat flavors including CentOS and scientific linux, the cookbook will delete any preexisting firewall rules, turn off SELinux,
uninstall apache, and remove any .bash_logout

One handy feature of this cookbook is that it will remove itself from the node's runlist on completion.  

Are there things that annoy you about your target Operating System?  Fork this cookbook and submit a pull request!

##################################

Sean O'Meara has released a couple of new cookbooks.  The pki cookbook which is a proof of concept PKI implementation, powered by inter-node convergence and stateful resource providers.

He's also released version 0.10. of the etchosts cookbook which installs and configures, you guessed it!,  a node's /etc/hosts file.

##################################

Jamie Winsor released version 0.9.3 of the artifact cookbook.  Use this to provide the Artifact Deploy LWRP to your cookbooks. 

What is the Artifact deploy lwrp, you ask? 

Well, it can be used to package build artifacts into a tar ball and deploy them. Artifacts are extracted from the package and managed 
in a deploy directory in the same fashion you've seen in the Opscode deploy resource or Capistrano's default deploy strategy. 

##################################

Fletcher Nichol has release version 0.2.0 of the vagrant_extras cookbook which includes some extra fixes and shims for running 
your recipes in a Vagrant VM.

By the way, did you hear that Vagrant has reached the 1.0 release milestone?

##################################

Nacer Laradji has released version 0.0.25 of the zabbix cookbook. 

##################################

Eric Wolfe's gnome and x-windows cookbooks are now both at version 0.0.2.  Both of these cookbooks are used as requirements for Oracle.

##################################

Wes Morgan released version 1.0.4 of the linode cookbook.  This is a collection of useful recipes for setting up Linodes

##################################

Many of the Opscode cookbooks were also recently updated. One of the changes that was recommended during the Opscode Community Summit
was to split up the opscode/cookbooks repository in to individual repositories, one for each cookbook. 

Much of the groundwork for doing this has been added to the cookbooks in this round of releases. 

Changes includes adding LICENSE and CONTRIBUTING files to each cookbook and moving the "changes" section from the README to a new 
CHANGELOG markdown file with each cookbook.  Some noteworthy updates include:

* iis now has support for adding apps and a few other fixes and improvements
* auto-clustering support was added to the rabbitmq cookbook
* the ssh_known_hosts cookbook now allows for adding arbitrary host keys from a data bag
* and a number of cookbooks now support additional platforms:
* chef-client now includes  support mac_os_x_server
* memcached now includes support for centos/rhel
* passenger_apache2 now includes support for archlinux

Other cookbooks updated in this release include:

* apt
* bluepill
* chef_handler
* database
* java
* nginx
* pacman
* pdns
* postgresql
* runit
* windows
* and users

For additional details, see Joshua Timberman's "Groundhog Edition" cookbook release announcement that was posted to the chef user mailing list.
